    "In this post, we’re continuing to read Eric Veach’s doctoral thesis. In our last installment, we covered the first half of the thesis, dealing with theoretical foundations for Monte Carlo rendering. This time we’re tackling chapters 8–9, including one of the key algorithms this thesis is famous for: multiple importance sampling. Without further ado, let’s tuck in!\n",

    "As before, this isn’t going to be a comprehensive review of everything in the thesis—it’s just a selection of things that made me go “oh, that’s cool”, or “huh! I didn’t know that”.\n",

    "If you’ve studied path tracing or physically-based rendering in the last twenty years, you’ve probably heard of Eric Veach. His Ph.D thesis, published in 1997, has been hugely influential in Monte Carlo rendering. Veach introduced key techniques like multiple importance sampling and bidirectional path tracing, and clarified a lot of the mathematical theory behind Monte Carlo rendering. These ideas not only inspired a great deal of later research, but are still used in production renderers today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, I decided to sit down and read this classic thesis in full. Although I’ve seen expositions of the central ideas in other places such as PBR, I’d never gone back to the original source. The thesis is available from Stanford’s site (scroll down to the very bottom for PDF links). It’s over 400 pages—a textbook in its own right—but I’ve found it very readable, with clearly presented ideas and incisive analysis. There’s a lot of formal math, too, but you don’t really need more than linear algebra, calculus, and some probability theory to understand it. I’m only about halfway through, but there’s already been some really interesting bits that I’d like to share. So hop in, and let’s read Veach’s thesis together!\n",

    "A few years ago I came across an interesting problem. I was trying to implement some custom texture filtering logic in a pixel shader. It was for a shadow map, and I wanted to experiment with filters beyond the usual hardware bilinear.\n",

    "Git provides partial clone and sparse checkout features that can make this happen for top-level repositories, but so far they aren’t available for submodules. That’s a hole I aimed to fill with this project. git-partial-submodule is a tool for setting up submodules with blobless clones. It can also save sparse-checkout patterns in your .gitmodules file, allowing them to be managed by version control, and automatically applied when the submodules are cloned.\n",

    "July 16, 2021 · Graphics, Math · 3 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read BRDF theory papers, you’ll often see mention of slope space. Sometimes, components of the BRDF such as NDFs or masking-shadowing functions are defined in slope space, or operations are done in slope space before being converted back to ordinary vectors or polar coordinates. However, the meaning and intuition of slope space is rarely explained. Since it may not be obvious exactly what slope space is, why it is useful, or how to transform things to and from it, I thought I would write down a gentler introduction to it.\n",

    "Back in 2013, I wrote a somewhat popular article about pseudorandom number generation on the GPU. In the eight years since, a number of new PRNGs and hash functions have been developed; and a few months ago, an excellent paper on the topic appeared in JCGT: Hash Functions for GPU Rendering, by Mark Jarzynski and Marc Olano. I thought it was time to update my former post in light of this paper’s findings.\n",

    "Making Your Own Container Compatible With C++20 Ranges\n",
    "March 20, 2021 · Coding · 4 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "With some of my spare time lately, I’ve been enjoying learning about some of the new features in C++20. Concepts and the closely-related requires clauses are two great extensions to template syntax that remove the necessity for all the SFINAE junk we used to have to do, making our code both more readable and more precise, and providing much better error messages (although MSVC has sadly been lagging in the error messages department, at the time of this writing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting C++20 feature is the addition of the ranges library (also ranges algorithms), which provides a nicer, more composable abstraction for operating on containers and sequences of objects. At the most basic level, a range wraps an iterator begin/end pair, but there’s much more to it than that. This article isn’t going to be a tutorial on ranges, but here’s a talk to watch if you want to see more of what it’s all about.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I’m going to discuss today is the process of adding “ranges compatibility” to your own container class. Many of the C++ codebases we work in have their own set of container classes beyond the STL ones, for a variety of reasons—better performance, more control over memory layouts, more customized interfaces, and so on. With a little work, it’s possible to make your custom containers also function as ranges and interoperate with the C++20 ranges library. Here’s how to do it.\n",

    "November 24, 2018 · Coding · 29 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a handy built-in function called enumerate(), which lets you iterate over an object (e.g. a list) and have access to both the index and the item in each iteration. You use it in a for loop, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i, thing in enumerate(listOfThings):\n",
    "    print(\"The %dth thing is %s\" % (i, thing))\n",
    "Iterating over listOfThings directly would give you thing, but not i, and there are plenty of situations where you’d want both (looking up the index in another data structure, progress reports, error messages, generating output filenames, etc).\n",

    "Using A Custom Toolchain In Visual Studio With MSBuild\n",
    "November 20, 2018 · Coding · 4 Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many of you, when I work on a graphics project I sometimes have a need to compile some shaders. Usually, I’m writing in C++ using Visual Studio, and I’d like to get my shaders built using the same workflow as the rest of my code. Visual Studio these days has built-in support for HLSL via fxc, but what if we want to use the next-gen dxc compiler?\n",
    "\n",
    "This post is a how-to for adding support for a custom toolchain—such as dxc, or any other command-line-invokable tool—to a Visual Studio project, by scripting MSBuild (the underlying build system Visual Studio uses). We won’t quite make it to parity with a natively integrated language, but we’re going to get as close as we can.\n",

So what are mesh shaders (and their counterparts, task shaders), why are graphics programmers so excited about them, and what might we be able to do with them?\n",

    "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic versatility, and cultural impact, Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, the highest-grossing music performer, and the richest female musician—the first billionaire with music as their main income.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\", and \"Look What You Made Me Do\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and contested with Big Machine for masters, re-recording four albums as Taylor's Version.[a] She explored indie folk styles in the 2020 surprise albums Folklore and Evermore, and experimented with pop subgenres on Midnights (2022) and the double album The Tortured Poets Department (2024). In the U.S., a record seven Swift albums have sold one million copies first-week each. Throughout the 2020s, Swift garnered the number-one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". She has undertaken six concert tours, including the Eras Tour (2023–2024), the highest-grossing tour of all time. Her films include Miss Americana (2020), All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), and The Eras Tour (2023)—the highest-grossing concert film.\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift is a subject of extensive media coverage and has a global fanbase of Swifties. Publications such as Rolling Stone and Billboard have listed her amongst history's greatest artists; she is the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Among other accolades, Swift has received 14 Grammy Awards (including a record four Album of the Year wins), a record five IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a string of Guinness World Records. She is the most-awarded artist of the American Music Awards (40), the Billboard Music Awards (49), and the MTV Video Music Awards (30).\n",

    "Life and career\n",
    "Early life\n",
    "Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor and was purposefully given a unisex first name.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] The siblings are of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[6][7][8] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[9] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21]\n",
    "\n",
    "At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31]\n",
    "\n",
    "2004–2008: Career beginnings and first album\n",
    "In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" At 14, Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing.[36] She left RCA Records due to the label's lack of care and their \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37]\n",

    "At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] Swift was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[42] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[43][44] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[45]\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[46] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances. This included opening for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[47] as a replacement for Eric Church.[48] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[46][28]\n",
    "\n",
    "Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[49] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[50][51][52] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[53][54] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[55] Brad Paisley,[56] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[57]\n",
    "\n",
    "Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[58] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[59] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[60] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[61] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[62] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[63] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[64]\n",

All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[72] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[73]\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[74] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[75] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[76] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[77] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[78] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[79] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[80]\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[81][82] She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler,[83] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One,[84] and wrote two songs—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[85][86] She wrote and recorded \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[87] \"Today Was a Fairytale\" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[88] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[89] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[90] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[91][92]\n",

    "Swift has ventured into diverse genres throughout her career, with critics mostly labelling her songs as pop,[c] country,[d] folk,[e] rock,[f] or alternative.[g] Her early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[266] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[267] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[268] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[269][270] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[94][271] Some critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[272][273] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray away from its traditional sound.[274][275]\n",
    "\n",
    "After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[276][277] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[278] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[279] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[157][280] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[281] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[282] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[283][284]\n",
    "\n",
    "Her 2020 alternative albums Folklore and Evermore explored indie folk and indie rock styles, incorporating a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, muted synthesizers, and drum pads.[265][285][286] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[287][288] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[286] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, restrained synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[289][290]\n",

    "On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[350] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[329] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[350] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[351] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[352]\n",

    "\n",
    "Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[358] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[359][352] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[360] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[361] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[362] philosopher,[363] and bard.[294]\n",
